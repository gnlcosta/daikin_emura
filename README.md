# Daikin Emura
This porject permits to control a **Daikin Emura** using a Raspberry Pi and a IR Led.
In other words, the software emulates the **DAIKIN ARC466A1** remote control.

## IR circuit
IR transmission must be 38Khz, to reach this frequency we use pin 12 (GPIO 18) where we can use (HW) PWM output.

IR led type: 940nm

Schematic:

## Board/OS supported:
  - Raspberry Pi Linux

## Dependencies
  - wiringPi

## Applications an contents
  - daikin_emura: it sends the command to Daikin Emura conditioner
  - cmds_raw: this dir contains all data (raw format) captured using an IR receiver LIRC (sudo mode2 -d /dev/lirc0 -m > <file>)
  - decode: it converts the raw data (LIRC capture) in a bit stream (see the cmds dir content after the make)
  - compare: it compares two or more files generated by "decode", in this way it is simple to see what are the bits used for single command (button)

## Compare two commands
To compare the On/Off command it is sufficient to run: `./compare cmds/daikin_onoff_on cmds/daikin_onoff_off`

Its output is:

Where the first lines are the bits transmitted with the commands. The lines with '*' show the bits changed (marked with *) from two commands.
The last three lines are respectively:
  - the bit sequence (byte per byte)
  - the byte sequence
  - the constant byte value among the commands compared
